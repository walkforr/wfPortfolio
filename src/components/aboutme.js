          Hello and welcome to my Profile. I am a current student in a coding
          bootcamp here at Georgia Tech right now gaining the skills to become a
          Full-Stack Web Developer. I've worked with many different technologies
          and frameworks such as Jquery, Axios, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, MongoDB, Node, and have
          experience working with API's, making ajax requests. I use CSS grid and flexbox when styling my html pages. I find it
          fun and easy to manage. I'm still finding little css tricks along the
          way but that's one of my go-tos.
        </p>

          Getting into coding really was the right move for me. I've always been
          infatuated with technology and how it makes our world turn. For me,
          the first time I truly fell in love with any type of technology was
          when I was very young and I saw my dad was playing the first
          Playstation. I can't describe how majestic it was to see someone press
          the 'OPEN' button, insert a CD, then see a game with beatiful colors
          like Crash Bandicoot or Final Fantasy VIII pop up on the screen and
          you be able to give the game commands via the controller. Ever since
          then I've had a dream of making a game or a program "one day" but it
          seemed out of reach becuase I was never exposed to the tech world nor
          did I know where to begin.

          In my teens I grew a passion for music and taught myself how to
          engineer songs and produce beats. Being an audio engineer and
          producer, you spend a LOT of time glued to your computer screen but
          it's what you love so it doesn't feel like "work" even though there
          are MANY frustrating problems that arise. This is what made me realize
          I wanted to get back to the dream I had as a kid, making programs.<mark> The
          process of coding is similar to that of the music production process
          for me. I like analyzing what's about to be made, coming up with a
          blueprint for how it's going to be made and then fulfilling the
          creative journey that it takes to be made.</mark>

          In January(2018) I met a network engineer/database manager who worked
          for HomeDepot and he opened the door for me to start learning code. He
          got me started with learning SQL but I soon found out that you
          couldn't create applications with just SQL so I found myself learning
          Swift becuase I wanted to make iOS apps. I've had some experience
          working a little bit with the Swift language this year. I plan on
          taking taking the knowledge I've learned with the Georgia Tech Coding
          Bootcamp and apply it to mobile development when I've completed this
          course. I'm also interested in Blockchain. I've heard that Blockchain will be a huge part of our
          future and I really would like to get in on this wave while it's
          early, plus I really support the decentralization aspect of it.

          Aside from coding, I'm a pretty easy going person. Fall is my favorite
          season. It's calm and not too cold(usually). I love baseball and
          football. Playing those sports in highschool taught me how to work as
          a team and how to keep your cool when things aren't going your way. I
          spend lot of time with my family, mostly eating tons of good food made
          by both of my grandmothers. My dad's side being from south Georgia and
          my Mom's side being from Cuba, I get the best of both worlds at the
          dinner table. To take a break from the world and relieve stress, I do
          a light workout/jog at least a couple times of week to keep my brain
          and health intact. I'm very dedicated with my work and don't like to
          waste time but I realize keeping balance is necesary to prosper.
